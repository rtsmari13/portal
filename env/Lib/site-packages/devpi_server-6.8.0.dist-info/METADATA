=============================================================================
devpi-server: server for private package indexes and PyPI caching
=============================================================================


PyPI cache
==========

You can point ``pip or easy_install`` to the ``root/pypi/+simple/``
index, serving as a transparent cache for pypi-hosted packages.


User specific indexes
=====================

Each user (which can represent a person, project or team) can have
multiple indexes and upload packages and docs via standard ``twine`` or
``setup.py`` invocations.  Users and indexes can be manipulated through
`devpi-client`_ and a RESTful HTTP API.


Index inheritance
=================

Each index can be configured to merge in other indexes so that it serves
both its uploads and all releases from other index(es).  For example, an
index using ``root/pypi`` as a parent is a good place to test out a
release candidate before you push it to PyPI.


Good defaults and easy deployment
=================================

Get started easily and create a permanent devpi-server deployment
including pre-configured templates for ``nginx`` and process managers.


Separate tool for Packaging/Testing activities
==============================================

The complementary `devpi-client`_ tool
helps to manage users, indexes, logins and typical setup.py-based upload and
installation workflows.

See https://doc.devpi.net on how to get started and further documentation.

.. towncrier release notes start

6.8.0 (2022-12-05)
==================

Features
--------

- Fix #929: Cache normalized project names per transaction on mirror index instances.


Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix #914: add locking to list_projects_perstage of mirror indexes to prevent multiple slow concurrent updates of the full project name list.

- Catch exceptions in async_httpget analog to httpget.

- Add locking to mirror name cache to prevent race condition on updates.


6.7.0 (2022-09-28)
==================

Features
--------

- Add nginx example to ``devpi-gen-config`` with caching of simple pages for installers like pip.

- Automatically check for ``+files`` when using ``--replica-file-search-path``.

- Set headers to prevent caching for simple links with stale results.


Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix #840: Correct url scheme in config if nginx is behind another proxy.


6.6.1 (2022-09-12)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix slowdown introduced in 6.6.0 when simple links for mirrors are requested more than once in the same thread.

- Removed preservation of original server uuid during import. Imported state is different from the original server. Replicas could not detect the change and get into an inconsistent state.

- Prevent cache trashing when updating simple links on mirrors for projects with huge number of releases.

- Preserve toxresult filenames during import to keep them being accessible on the same URLs after the fix for #686 in 5.2.0.


6.6.0 (2022-08-16)
==================

Features
--------

- Fix #592: return dict from ``list_projects_perstage`` of mirrors where the values contain the un-normalized project name. This allows support in devpi-web 4.1.0 to index them correctly.

- Check name in project list instead of fetching project page for mirrors. This improves response times and avoids leaking typos of private package names upstream.

- Use ETag header if provided by mirror to reduce bandwidth usage and latency.

- Prevent concurrent updates of simple links on mirrors with a short lived lock.

- Support `PEP-691 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0691/>`_ conformant fetching for mirrors, and requests with JSON result for installers. Proxy servers should add compression support for the ``application/vnd.pypi.simple.v1+json`` content type (``gzip_types`` for nginx).


Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix #743: support PEP427 escaped wheels with local version, where the + is replaced by _.

- Fix #895: store and return content of data-yanked.

- Fix #908: include basic auth from ``mirror_url`` when fetching packages.

- Fix #914: switch to write transaction as late as possible when streaming a file from a mirror.


6.5.1 (2022-04-25)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix traceback when trying to delete already deleted release or toxresult.

- Preserve index config settings of plugins during import instead of aborting, even if the plugin isn't installed during import.
